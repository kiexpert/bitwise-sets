## 🧠 What is BitwiseSets?

**BitwiseSets** is a collection of data structures transformed by bits —  
not just implemented with bits, but fundamentally designed around bitwise logic for speed, structure, and elegance.

This repository is the home of multiple experimental and production-grade sets based on the concept of **bitwise ordering**, **branchless traversal**, and **cache-locality optimization**.

## 🔥 Philosophy

- **화(化)** — Transformation  
  비트를 통해 기존 구조를 새로운 방식으로 *화(化)*하다

- **火** — Speed  
  분기 없는 탐색과 정렬, 메모리 접근 최적화를 통한 *불같은 성능*

- **華** — Beauty  
  논리적 미학과 구조적 단순함의 *화려한 구조체*

## 📦 Components

| Set Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `WkBitwiseSortSet` | A blazing-fast, branchless set where order emerges directly from bits — not reversed, just right. |
| `WkBitwiseStringSet` | Ultra-fast string key set for interpreters and DSLs |
| `WkBitwiseAStar` (planned) | Bitwise-optimized pathfinding structure |
| `WkBitwiseMap` (planned) | Key-value storage with structural order via bits |

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Branchless traversal** – no if/else in search path  
- ✅ **Cache-friendly memory layout**  
- ✅ **Compact & minimalistic design**  
- ✅ **Fast insert/delete without rebalancing**
